# RockPaperScissors

DESCRIPTION: This project is part of the Foundations portion of The Odin Project Curriculum. The purpose of this project
is to put programming concepts such as conditional statements, loops, variables, and functions. 

WHAT I LEARNED FROM THIS PROJECT: Quickly after starting work on this project, I realized I would have to research possible solutions to the problems presented and experiment to find a workable solution. Being able to find a solution is a valuable skill for a programmer to have so I was grateful for the experience this project provided. 

MY MAIN TAKEAWAY FROM THIS PROJECT: Aside from the satisfaction of having completed a working game that I can show to family and friends, I feel like this project has helped to bolster my confidence that programming is a skill that I can learn. It definetly will not be the easiest thing in the world to do, but as the old saying goes, "The best way to eat an elephant is one bite at a time." And in this case, <"corny dad joke>the best way to learn programming is one byte at a time.<"/corny dad joke">
